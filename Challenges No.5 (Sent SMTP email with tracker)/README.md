# Sent SMTP email with tracker

Yet another Email challenge. 

1. this time you should use the smtp library to send ytbryan@gmail.com an email with an attachment. 
You can easily find the solution on the internet. 

2. Bonus: Insert an invisible email tracking using one of those email tracking tools. 
Include a link to the tool that you used to track my clicking. You are probably using an invisible pixel.

Let me know if it works out. ie if you can detect that I have opened your email. :D 

Good luck!
